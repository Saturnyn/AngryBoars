==========

A small game submitted to the JS13K contest.

**WARNING : Looking at the source may burn your eyes !**

Seriously the code is quite ugly. At first, it was fun to code something without caring too much about the good practices, but it made the finishing rush unnecessarily painful. I'll try to refactor it later but I will probably be too busy (read lazy) to do it. Consider yourself officially warned :)

Repo content:
- src: the raw game files
- small: the same thing but minified in order to fit the 13kb limit
- old: previous builds of the game, give it a look if you want to see how the project evolved.
